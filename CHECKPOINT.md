# CHECKPOINT — Current Project State

Last verified: 2026-10-19 — verify_docs.py 74/74 · drift_test.py 16/16 (drive C's rule, proposed) · the app suites below as of 15 October
main: the merge and the documentation restructure (14 October), the results tab's schema fix (15 October, on Jad's go) · sim-v1 not tagged yet (plan v3 phase 3) · plant_sha 3c48890dd15bc116 (Python 3.12.10) · derived_sha 326c0835548975e2 · fingerprint schema 2

The previous CHECKPOINT.md, every session from 9 September to 14 October, is
`STATE_HISTORY.md` part B, verbatim. This file holds the current state only: the
permanent rules are `CLAUDE.md`, the history is `STATE_HISTORY.md`.

## Current objective

Test whether preview information is worth acquiring (the H/τ criterion,
`CLAUDE.md`). The two newest ablations, X1 and X2, did not settle it, and the
knock model the agents learn against is untested until drive C.

## Verified current state (each line names the script or file that proves it)

- Drive C was driven on 18–19 October and covered neither part: the logging
  was right, the driving was not (Jad's side's check, `drive_c_check.py`).
- X2 (11–13 October): INCONCLUSIVE on five pairs, the agents not converged
  (`python analyse_x2.py` -> `results/X2_RESULT.txt`; `results/x2_convergence.txt`).
- X1 (8–9 October): preview's effect below the MEI of 5.43 points of cut, 17 of
  23 pairs, sign p 0.0173 (`python analyse_x1.py` -> `results/X1_RESULT.txt`).
- The plant carries the four steps agreed on 30 September (`75ca65f`), and the
  premise reads baseline 848.1 at 883 °C (`python check_premise.py`).
- Ghassan's `GRA-2340394` (`c16b857`) was merged into Jad's work on 14 October
  (`cc5468f`; every conflict, both sides, in `conflict_2026-10-14.md`). Every
  simulation file is byte-identical to his last push, and his `check_premise`,
  `validate` and `test_reward` print his figures on Jad's machine.
- `python verify_docs.py`: 74 of 74 checks pass, the SIZE check among them.
- G-CTX passed: in a fresh session every memory file together is 5.8k tokens
  (Jad's `/context`, 14 October).
- The results tab names the plant of Phase D, D2 and C4: made on another plant,
  `sep17-before-merge`'s, each file read by its own fingerprint schema
  (`ca2cd73`, `2fd9aed`; `SESSION_REPORT_2026-10-15_results-schema.md`).
- App suites (15 October, Python 3.12.10): `python -m app.test_replay` 49 of 49,
  node 306 of 306, `app.test_results` 123 of 124 (the one needs `pwsh`);
  `app.test_agents` 22 failing, 19 of them the agents page refusing the old
  agents, and `app.test_simulation` 1 (its asset check), both as on `main` before.

## In progress (who · branch · what)

- Ghassan · `main` · drive C's decision rule, AGREED 19 October by Jad and
  Ghassan (decisions 14–23; `results/DRIVE_C_RULE.md`); its analysis script
  is being written (`SESSION_REPORT_2026-10-19_driveC-rule.md`).

## Blockers

- The knock model is untested: drive C decides how much of every agent's
  margin is real.
- Drive C's repeat waits for the rule's analysis script.
- Thirteen validation decisions wait for Jad's and Ghassan's columns
  (`results/VALIDATION_DECISIONS.md`); nothing is relabelled, re-preregistered
  or retrained until they are answered.

## Next actions (in order)

1. Drive C: commit the agreed rule's analysis script; run its stage A blind on
   the 18–19 October files; then repeat drive C (`logs/DRIVE_PLAN.md`), then A
   and D on one trip. Nobody computes target minus actual on a drive C file
   before stage C.
2. The validation decisions.
3. The learning lab's pins move to the live plant (`team/jad.md`). The agents
   page reads each agent's own fingerprint schema and its tests stop copying
   `runs_c4`'s `meta.json`; `test_simulation`'s asset check learns the `?v=`
   suffix (`SESSION_REPORT_2026-10-15_results-schema.md`, section 2).
4. Plan v3 phase 3: tag `sim-v1`, write `CHANGELOG.md` and the results index.
5. The parallel items of 30 September (Ghassan's twenty on multi-climb roads,
   the spark-capped rescoring of Jad's 48, Chapter 4 with both branches side by
   side and never pooled, the battery of Phase E) and the app's backlog are
   `STATE_HISTORY.md` part E, verbatim. X1 and X2 came after them: check an item
   before taking it up.
6. For Ghassan, before the next training: `train.py`'s `CLOSED` list has no
   `wideair_dt1`, though X2's result was published on 13 October (session
   report of 15 October, 2.3).

## Files outside git (where · last backup · manifest)

- Trained agents (`runs*/`) and the per-step records (`*_record.npz`) live on
  the machines that trained them. Jad's machine: a backup of 14 October, 4,391
  files, 2.5 GB, VERIFIED, with its `MANIFEST.csv` and `SHA256SUMS`; one copy,
  on the same disk; a Google Drive copy and a USB copy are still to make.
  Checked 15 October: its 978 agent files are unchanged on disk, and `C:` is
  still the only disk (session report of 15 October, 2.4).
- `GRAD-agent-backups/2026-09-23` and `2026-09-24` (`runs_c4`, sha-checked).
